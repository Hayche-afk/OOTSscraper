## Web Scraper for the Order of the Stick

This is a persistent web scraper for the Order of the Stick web comic.

It downloads every page from the webcomic, numbers it, and saves it to a directory. It also tracks how far along it is in the comic and will come back to any point where it stops, be it the most recently published or in case of an error in downloading the comic.

It will flag any errors as they happen but as of comic #1166 that doesn't seem to happen.

## A note

If you're going to do this, and can afford to do so, consider buying something from the Order of the Stick's store: http://www.giantitp.com/Shop.html

If you enjoy the stripp enough that you want to download every image it's worth supporting it financially.

## Future Plans

Now that it downloads every strip (unlike the first version of this scraper) I will most likely not be updating this again.

Enjoy!
