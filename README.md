## Web Scraper for the Order of the Stick

This is a simple web scraper for the Order of the Stick web comic.

It downloads every page from the webcomic, numbers it, and saves it to a directory. 

It will flag any errors as they happen but as of comic #1166 that doesn't seem to happen.

## A note

If you're going to do this, and can afford to do so, consider buying something from the Order of the Stick's store: http://www.giantitp.com/Shop.html

If you enjoy the stripp enough that you want to download every image it's worth supporting it financially.

## Future Plans

Now that it downloads every strip (unlike the first version of this scraper) I will most likely not be updating this again.

Enjoy!
