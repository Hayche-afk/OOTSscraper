## Web Scraper for the Order of the Stick

This is a persistent web scraper for the Order of the Stick web comic.

It downloads every page from the webcomic, numbers it, and saves it to a directory. It also tracks how far along it is in the comic and will come back to any point where it stops, be it the most recently published or in case of an error in downloading the comic.

It will flag errors in the terminal but will not log them. 

##Update

The Order of the Stick went through a bit of a redesign after the server shift and the creation of the patreon page. This included a significant tune-up on things behind the scenes, so the entirety of the scraper needed to be redone. If you've used an earlier version of this scraper you're probably going to need to update to this one, delete the shelve files, and run it again from scratch. My apologies. As of comic 1194 this runs without a hitch. 

## A note

If you're going to do this, and can afford to do so, consider buying something from the Order of the Stick's store: http://www.giantitp.com/Shop.html

Now that he has a patreon, you should absolutely support it there too: https://www.patreon.com/oots/

If you enjoy the stripp enough that you want to download every image it's worth supporting it financially.

## Future Plans

Now that this is persistent I will most likely not be updating this again unless there is a significant redesign of the site, again.

Enjoy!
